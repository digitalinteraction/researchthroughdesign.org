    <meta property='og:type' content="Website" />
    <meta property='og:description' content="Research Through Design (RTD) is a new, experimental conference that supports the dissemination of practice–based design research. RTD2019 will revolve around the theme ‘Method and Critique’. The goal is to problematize their assumed incompatibility through an exploration of the contemporary material, social, economic and technological shifts in design research and practice that call for both systemic thinking and criticality. ‘Rooms of Interest’ and ‘Exhibition’ will remain the heart of the conference, where we will critically explore the frictions and correspondences among different RTD traditions. The conference will take place in Delft and Rotterdam, NL, between the 19th and 22nd of March 2019." />

          <p class="bodytext-trans-18">
          Design is rapidly being widened and disrupted by data technologies such as the Internet of Things, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. This has a profound effect on Research through Design (RTD) too.
          <br /><br />
          As technology begins to enable the things we make to make things too, and with increased autonomy, designers will need a finer understanding of the recursive relationship between the <span class="italic">‘people who make things,’</span> the <span class="italic">‘things that make other things,’</span> and the <span class="italic">‘things that make people’</span>. Algorithmically enabled and connected, things can generate identity (or hamper it) by curating content, produce care (or discrimination) by performing assistance, and generate value (or not) by arranging smart contracts. 
          <br /><br />
          This new relationship collapses the traditional division between participation (at design time), interaction (at use time), and the (planned) creation and distribution of products and services that design has inherited from previous practices of skilful crafting and industrial design manufacturing – shifting the locus of design to uncharted territories. So how can designers participate in this expanded, emergent world of design? And with whom, or what, will they be doing their part? 
          <br /><br />
          For example, how can teams of diverse human experts and artificial agencies be aligned in a RTD project, doing the things that include design? Who (or what) has to participate, when and how – in what role? How can artificial perspectives be brought into the design process thoughtfully and responsibly? How to critique (not just vet) the assumptions and design decisions that get encoded in an algorithm, and the interactions the algorithm is enabled to learn from? How to develop capacity for ethical responses to be shared between distributed entities, humans and nonhumans?

After working in metadesign, collaborative and open design processes, she has during the last years focused on the challenges that a permeating digitalisation means for the field of design. Her recent research in thing centered design engages with things in new ways, with the starting point that things now hold both perception and possible agency (e.g., AI), and thus participate in design and use in ways that previous industrially produced objects could not.

          <p class="bodytext-trans-18">
            Research through Design is the designerly contribution to the creating of new knowledge. Knowledge that can be used by others. And brought about by designerly interventions such as speculating about the future, making prototypes, and engaging with complexity and ambiguity without necessarily trying to <span class="italic">‘box them in’</span>. 
  <br /><br />

          Over the past decade design has grown into a scientific discipline, which is not only worthy as an object of study, but is also offering a unique contribution to the ways new knowledge can be produced. Research through Design (RtD) falls in that latter offer, with the core contribution of opening <span class="italic">‘a not-yet-existing future’</span> by making and [using] prototypes and other artifacts. 
          <br /><br />
          These new ways of doing research involve embracing complexity and ambiguity, reframing the object of study during a project, and often working with a broad set of stakeholders in different roles. This offers a number of challenges to the way research projects are organized, planned, and funded. 
          <br /><br />
          For example, what are the criteria by which a RtD proposal should be judged? How can practitioners (e.g., design agencies) be involved during the project, if they are not in the role of researchers, and yet provide essential value to the design actions? What forms of deliverables and dissemination should be expected? How can a project be re-arranged when a re-framing requires new parties to take part in the collaboration? How do these needs fit the current disciplinary spectrum of funding institutions?
