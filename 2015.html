    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the website for the second biennial Research through Design (RTD) conference that was held in Cambridge UK between the 25th and 27th March 2015. We thank all of the attendees, chairs, programme committee members, reviewers and student volunteers for making this event so interesting, fun, and memorable. Visit the <a href="2015/experiences.html">Experiences</a> page to see a snapshot of the event documentation.</p>

<p>Research through Design (RTD) is a new conference series that supports the dissemination of practice-based design research through a novel and experimental format, comprising a curated exhibition accompanied by round-table discussions in ‘Rooms of Interest’. Building on the success of the inaugural RTD conference held at the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art in 2013, <a href="http://localhost:9000/2013/researchthroughdesign" target="_blank">Praxis + Poetics: Research through Design</a>, the 2015 conference took place at the new European lab of <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/cambridge/" target="_blank">Microsoft Research</a> in the centre of Cambridge, an exciting venue for exploring what research through design means in the early 21st Century. </p>

<p>RTD 2015 offered a diverse <a href="2015/programme.html">programme</a> of peer-reviewed work and invited talks. As with the first conference, RTD 2015 aimed to foreground the materiality of design research, placing its artefacts, processes, and practices centre stage. The exhibition was used as a platform for presenting and demonstrating research processes and outputs, and for generating debate about the role of the design practitioner and their work in a research context. We also invited registrations from those wishing to attend and contribute to the discussions around this emerging area of design research.</p>

<p>Please see our <a href="2015/proceedings.html">Proceedings</a> page for details on accepted work. RTD 2015 included an exciting programme of invited ‘<a href="2015/programme.html">Provocations</a>’ – plenary talks that took place throughout the conference for inspiring further discussion and debate around the conference themes. Documentation of the conference experience will be published soon. In the meantime see: Ross Atkin’s <a href="http://rossnotes.tumblr.com/post/115020146429/from-the-research-through-design-conference-held" target="_blank">RTD2015 Sketchnotes</a> (@rossatkin); Jimmy Tidey’s blogged <a href="http://jimmytidey.co.uk/blog/three-short-reflections-on-the-research-through-design-conference/" target="_blank">reflections</a> (@Jimmytidey); and our @RTD2015 Twitter feed.</p>

<h2>Peer-reviewed submissions process</h2>

<p>In total, we accepted 35 submissions for RTD 2015. This is 64% of Stage 2 submissions, and 15% of the total number of submissions we received at Stage 1. We would like to thank all authors who have submitted work, and extend appreciation to the Programme Committee members and Reviewers who have volunteered considerable time, effort and care to review and feedback on submissions.</p>

<p>You can still see the Call for Submissions (now closed) on our <a href="2015/submissions.html">Submissions</a> page to get a sense of the submissions process for RTD 2015.</p>
