      <h2>Venue</h2>

<p>RTD 2015 is hosted by Microsoft Research, in their new building located in the centre of Cambridge, UK. Opened in 2012, the venue is a short walk from Cambridge railway station and will provide a stunning backdrop to exploring what research through design means in the 21st Century.</p>

<p>The city of Cambridge is one of the world’s most famous University cities, and is at the heart of the UK’s high-technology community - home of the ‘Silicon Fen’. Alongside the University of Cambridge and its historic buildings, the city offers its visitors a choice of galleries and a buzzing theatre scene. You can go punting on the River Cam, enjoy a picnic in the park, join a walking tour of the city, or explore further afield from the seat of a bicycle on cycle paths in and around the city.</p>
